Audio Content Creator
A professional open-source tool for producing, processing, and transforming voice content in real time.

Are you recording a podcast, streaming live, creating voiceovers for videos, or simply want to add uniqueness to your voice? Audio Content Creator is a comprehensive workstation that turns your microphone into a powerful tool for creativity. No more expensive closed-source programs with limited capabilities.

Create professional sound with open source.

Key features
Studio recording and mixing: Multi-track editor with VST plugin support for voice recording, effects overlay, and audio track mixing. Record interviews, monologues, and sound effects.

Library of real voice modulation effects: A collection of dozens of high-quality presets and filters for real-time voice transformation: tone change, pitch correction, robot, choir, radio, telephone, echo, and reverb effects.
Intelligent noise cancellation and sound clarity enhancement: Built-in AI algorithms for background noise removal (fan, keyboard, street noise), hiss suppression, and echo cancellation to ensure your voice sounds clear in any environment.

Streaming integration (OBS, Discord, Zoom): Works as a virtual audio device (virtual microphone). Send your processed voice directly to OBS Studio, Streamlabs, Discord, Skype, or any video calling software without delay.

Voice sampler and looper (Sampler/Looper): Record short phrases or sounds and assign them to hotkeys for instant playback during a stream or recording. Create your own sound banks.

Automation and Scripting: Create complex scripts to change effects over time or link them to actions in other programs via API.

How it works and security
Local audio processing: All audio streams are processed exclusively on your computer. None of your voice data is sent to external servers. This guarantees complete confidentiality of your recordings and conversations.

Transparency and openness: As an open source project, anyone can check the code to make sure there are no hidden recording functions (keyloggers, spyware) or data leaks. You have complete control over what you install.

Safe integration: Working through standard system audio drivers (virtual cable, ASIO, WASAPI) does not require granting the program elevated privileges or access to personal files.

“Analysis Only” mode: An optional mode in which the program visualizes effects but does not transmit sound further, ideal for safe configuration and testing.

Who is Audio Content Creator designed for?
Streamers (Twitch, YouTube, Trovo): To add unique voice reactions, character voiceovers, hide or change your voice in real time.

Podcasters and bloggers: For professional recording, noise removal, and easy correction.

Video creators (YouTube, TikTok): For voicing videos and creating voice effects for characters.

Teachers and webinar hosts: For improving voice quality during online broadcasts.

Musicians and sound designers: For experimenting with vocals and creating unique sound textures.

Game developers and indie developers: For prototyping and creating temporary or final character voiceovers.

It is strictly prohibited to use the program for fraud, misleading people about your identity, or creating harmful or harassing content.

You are solely responsible for the content created using this tool and for complying with the laws (including defamation, copyright, and personal data laws) in your jurisdiction.
